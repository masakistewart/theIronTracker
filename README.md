## The Iron Tracker
My project is a workout tracker. It allows the user to sign up and set goals. I use a chart api to visualize the data as they update their goals.

#### Feature list
<ul>
	<li>Login And Log via super secure local storage :P</li>
	<li>Allows the user to set goals</li>
	<li>Charts progress using chart.js</li>
	<li>Bootstrap with the Superman theme on the front end</li>
	<li>Not using a database all JS Objects and Arrays</li>
	<li>random animal picture for those who dont enter a pic url</li>
	<li>Random Chuck Norris Jokes on Programming via the Internet Chuck Norris DB</li>
	<li> -- add destroy as an option for goals -- </li>
</ul>

#### Hope you enjoy The Iron Tracker
